The files are heavy, which will cause problems downstream. We suggest placing your files in `projects/sed-fitting/data` folder (for Chang catalogs) and `projects/sed-fitting/output` folder (for your own Prospector output files). These folders are added in the `.gitignore` file in the root, and so anything in these folders will be ignored by Git.\n",

Again, best not to do this inside the Git repository as the bash script will download several large libraries. If you are feeling brave, you can try doing it from this repository, but first make sure to add the libraries to `.gitignore`. <br>\n",
