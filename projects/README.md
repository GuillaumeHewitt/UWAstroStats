As you learn the concepts in this course, you will be applying them to one of our $N$ exciting projects. 

This folder contains all the information and data you should need to complete them. Choose wisely!

## Fitting galaxies to get their mass and redshift

We look at the light distribution in galaxies across the entire wavelength spectrum to learn about their properties: mass, redshift, and others, such as metallicity or dust content. 

Having a full spectrum of a galaxy certainly helps, but often all we have are measurements of total fluxes in some photometric bands: UV, green, IR, ... 

If that's the case, we need to fit the Spectral Energy Distribution (or a spectrum) we think the galaxy has to our photometric data points. This fit not only gives us an estimate of the galaxy's spectrum, but also gives us values (and uncertainties) of useful quantities like mass and redshift.

In this project, you will build your own tools to estimate mass and reshift of $N$ nearby galaxies using 1) machine learning techniques and 2) MCMC spectral energy distribution fitting. See if you can beat the current state-of-the-art code [Prospector](https://github.com/bd-j/prospector)!
